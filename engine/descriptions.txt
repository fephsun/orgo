Sn1, E1, Sn2, E2, E1cB: figure out later

Conversion of alcohol to leaving group
Candidate reactants: hydroxyl groups
MsCl or TsCl or TfCl, in pyridine
Adds Ms or Ts or Tf to the hydroxyl group, replacing the hydroxyl group's H. (OH goes to OMs.)



Chloride from hydroxyl
Candidate reactants: hydroxyl group attached to alkaney carbon
SOCl2
Replace hydroxyl with Cl. Flip stereochemistry.

Bromide from hydroxyl
Candidate reactants: hydroxyl group attached to alkaney carbon
PBr3
Replace hydroxyl with Br. Flip stereochemistry.

Iodide from hydroxyl
Candidate reactants: hydroxyl group attached to alkaney carbon
P, I2
Replace hydroxyl with I. Flip stereochemistry.

Alkene from hydroxyl
Candidate reactants: hydroxyl group attached to alkaney carbon
POCl2 in pyridine
Remove OH and produce a double bond touching the carbon the OH was attached to. Probably follows Zaitsev's rule: produce the more substituted alkene.
