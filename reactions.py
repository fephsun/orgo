HX in CH2Cl2
Candidate reactants: alkenes, alkynes
Adds the X to the Markovnikov-most carbon, and the H to the other carbon. Neither syn nor anti (because carbocation intermediate).
**UNLESS the alkene is next to a carbonyl (i.e. Michael acceptor). In this case, the halogen is added anti-Markovnikov. We might want to allow users to use this 
reaction, but not allow it to be used when we generate random synthesis problems.
If reacting an alkyne:
if 1eqv specified --> add once
if 2eqv or if excess specified --> add twice
if no quantity specified --> don't let it be a valid reaction? Some sort of feedback to make user specify _how much_ when reacting with alkynes (which is a good habit 
to have) would be nice."""
